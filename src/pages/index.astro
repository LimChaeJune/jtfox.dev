          A developer who creates value beyond code, pursuing balanced growth

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <article class="text-base text-gray">
          <p>
            Rather than being just a 'coder' who implements functionality, I
            aspire to be a 'developer' who <b
              >solves problems and creates value</b
            >. I believe the value of development lies in the process of
            collaborating, growing, and achieving better results together.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe <b>soft skills</b> are just as important as technical capabilities.
            Effective <b>communication</b> and a <b>trustworthy attitude</b> are
            key elements that determine growth as a developer. Beyond writing good
            code, I want to be someone who grows with the team and creates their
            own value.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy reading and working out, pursuing a balanced life of
            knowledge, virtue, and physical health. I believe that a healthy
            body, deep thinking, and wise life attitude have a positive
            influence not only in my career but in life as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            I aim to share knowledge, not just information. I want to share
            understanding and insights, not just simple tips.
