# Mobile Banking App Redesign

## Project Overview

This project focused on modernizing a legacy banking application for FinTech Solutions. The client required a secure, intuitive mobile experience that would appeal to both younger users and traditional banking customers while maintaining strict financial industry compliance.

## Challenges

- Outdated security protocols needing modernization
- Poor user experience leading to low app store ratings (2.3/5)
- Complex financial transactions requiring simplified interfaces
- High user drop-off during account registration (68%)
- Integration with multiple banking systems and APIs

## Solutions Implemented

Our team developed a cross-platform solution using React Native and TypeScript, ensuring consistent experience across iOS and Android. We implemented a modular architecture with comprehensive test coverage using Jest.

Key features developed:

- Biometric authentication with fallback security options
- Streamlined account registration (reduced from 8 steps to 3)
- Real-time transaction monitoring and notifications
- Customizable dashboard with drag-and-drop widgets
- Intelligent expense categorization and budgeting tools
- Dark mode and accessibility features

## Results

- 35% increase in daily active users
- 60% reduction in registration abandonment
- 45% increase in mobile payment transactions
- App store rating improved to 4.7/5
- 28% decrease in customer support calls

## Technical Implementation

Redux was essential for managing the complex application state and ensuring data consistency across different banking features. Firebase provided secure authentication and real-time database capabilities, while custom encryption layers were added for sensitive financial data handling.
